1
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,431
I think my period's coming.

2
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,839
DOORBELL RINGS

3
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,550
OK...

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,476
Hi!

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,670
Are you all right?
What's happened? Are you hurt?

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,916
- Oh, good.

7
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,999
Nice haircut.
- It's better.

8
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,715
Can I come in?

9
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,478
Why didn't you text?

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,079
Well, I just thought I'd pop by.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,030
Tell the truth.

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,229
I need to speak to Martin.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,111
Martin?

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,594
Martin. Martin.

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,280
Why on earth would you
want to speak to...

16
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,651
CLAIRE: Martin?
- Hello!

17
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:27,989
Hello! My wife in my study, hello.
Give me two.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,554
Gangbangs, Asian.
I'd put a tenner on it.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,593
MARTIN SIGHS
- Finished.

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,157
Well, hello, you.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,237
MARTIN LAUGHS

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,953
She wants to talk to you
about something.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,798
Oh, well, must be my lucky day.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,354
You said she only likes
to talk to people she fancies.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,913
THEY LAUGH

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,756
Ugh.

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,871
Can you leave us?
- Why?

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,434
He's organizing your
surprise birthday party.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,549
Er... you know, I hate surp... OK.

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,390
I have a week to organise that now.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,475
Best of luck.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,669
Nice top.

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,358
Ugh. Thanks.

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,677
Do you deal in sculptures as well as
paintings and papier-méché?

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,030
Depends on the quality of the piece.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,752
Fuck me.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,354
MARTIN:
What a pair!

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,720
MARTIN LAUGHS
- I know, right?

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,279
Where'd you get this?

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,359
Oh, just a...
stole it from a market.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,233
Oh. It's quite a piece.
Who's the artist?

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,153
Just <i>a...</i> market artist.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Huh.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,559
If I sell it, I take ten percent. Deal?

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,749
Deal.

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,918
OK. Well, I'll get her
photographed now.

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,634
Don't tell Claire, please.

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,909
Or what?

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,236
Or I'll... I'II...
- MARTIN LAUGHS

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,669
You got nothing on me, princess.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,154
SHE LAUGHS

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,396
Or I'll tell her you were
watching gangbangs.

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,032
Please don't do that again.

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,838
I wasn't, by the way.

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,355
Ugh.

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,919
Disappointing.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,112
Erm... Where did you get that?

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,639
Oh, I brought it with me.

59
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,432
No, you didn't. Give it back.

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,679
Tight.

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,358
Patch things up with Harry?

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,438
Yeah. We're... engaged, so.

63
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,879
God! What?

64
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,593
No, we're not engaged.

65
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,075
No, he's back at the flat,
packing up all his stuff again.

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,552
Oh. I'm sorry.

67
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,755
He really used to make you laugh.

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,677
He also used to say things like...

69
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,552
You're not like other girls.

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,750
You can... keep up.

71
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,949
HE SLURPS

72
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,752
I like Harry. I liked his songs.

73
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,989
I admire how much Harry
commits to our breakups.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,033
I mean, this is a new detail.

75
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,832
But he does usually go the extra mile.

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,474
A few times, he's even
cleaned the whole flat.

77
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,519
HARRY SOBS

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,710
Oh God, no.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,752
Like it's a crime scene.

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,589
I've considered timing a breakup for when
the flat needs a bit of a going over.

81
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,276
I don't think this is working.

82
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,435
What?

83
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,512
But he always leaves...

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,754
him.

85
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,359
To come back for.

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,233
Got to think about all the people
I can have sex with now.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,396
I'm not obsessed with sex.

88
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,716
I just can't stop thinking about it.

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,078
The performance of it

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,157
the awkwardness of it

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,111
the drama of it.

92
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,714
The moment you realise
someone wants your body.

93
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,917
Not so much the feeling of it.

94
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,038
Probably got about 48 hours
before Harry comes back.

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,312
I should get on it.

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,470
I took half an hour trying to look nice

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,955
and I ended up looking amazing!

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,399
Just one of those days.

99
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,114
Gorgeous, fresh-faced,
new top, little bit sexy

100
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,912
on my way to open my café.

101
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,951
And... Oh God.

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,150
Yeah, you check me out, chub-chub,
'cause it's never going to happen.

103
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,599
Oh God, he can't believe
how attractive I am.

104
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,360
Kind of worried I'm going to make
a sex offender out of the poor guy.

105
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:03,356
Here we go.
This better be good. Here we go.

106
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,152
MAN COUGHS
- Walk of shame!

107
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,120
BIKE BELL RINGS
- CYCLIST: Oi!

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,917
Oh.
- SHE LAUGHS

109
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,394
Dropped my cucumber.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,070
Just dropped my...

111
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,919
Um... Could I get a
cheese sandwich to go, please?

112
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,189
Sure.

113
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,714
That'll be, um... £12.55, please.

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,230
London.

115
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,476
SHE LAUGHS
- Thanks.

116
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,233
Why do I recognise her?
Is she famous?

117
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,312
Boo's death hit the papers.

118
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,194
Local café girl gets hit by bike,
and a car, and another bike.

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,599
Oh no, she used to work here.
- Oh.

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,838
I'm sorry, I don't have any change.

121
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,678
MAN SIGHS

122
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,352
The next man who walks in here
is getting ridden to death.

123
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,635
,_

124
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,795
Hi.

125
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,714
Not ideal.

126
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,833
Um... How are you? Darling?

127
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,355
You busy?

128
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,950
A bit.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,798
Well, I won't keep you.

130
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,716
I just wanted to talk about
when you dropped in the other night.

131
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,194
OK.

132
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,517
I can't help thinking that I... we...

133
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,358
Yeah?
- I know that we...

134
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,549
don't have much
of a chance to...

135
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,957
Did you take the sculpture?
Did you um...

136
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,032
take the sculpture?
Did you take it?

137
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,637
No. What sculpture?

138
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,035
Oh right. Right. Good.

139
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,389
Good. You said, "No," and that...

140
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,755
that means I can go.
All right, great.

141
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,595
Phew.

142
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,236
Are you happy? Are you healthy?

143
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:34,736
DAD:
Hmm.

144
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,912
GIRLS CHATTER

145
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,713
Hey. Do you do, like,
hot organic-y food?

146
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,433
Of course.

147
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,151
What would you like?

148
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,793
Um, I like risotto.
- Yeah.

149
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,592
Sure. Grab a seat.

150

GIRLS CHATTER

151
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Hey.

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,235
Hi.

153
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Hey.

154
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:15,576
Hey.

155
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,954
It's nice to see you.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,274
You too.

157
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,073
Fucked me up the arse.

158
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,440
What are you getting?

159
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,189
Oh, just these.

160
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,993
For my tiny, bleeding vagina.

161
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,056
Hot.

162
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,797
You?

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,875
Stock cubes.

164
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,194
Hot.

165
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,558
Hope it's a light flow.

166
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,670
Oh.
- SHE LAUGHS

167
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,233
It never is.

168
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,315
It never... is.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,719
Listen, you around later?

170
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,755
Er...

171
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,120
Yes, fucking yes please, yes.

172
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,514
Yes.

173
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,595
Cool.

174
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,677
Cool. Bye.

175
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,634
Yes!

176
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,320
YOGA GIRL 1:
I'm so happy with my body now.

177
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,269
Like, I don't have to define
myself by how I look

178
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,152
'cause I've just got
a fucking great body!

179
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,996
YOGA GIRL 2:
Yeah.

180
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,856
YOGA GIRL 1:
Yeah! I can like, do other stuff now.

181
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,836
YOGA GIRL 2:
That's so great!

182
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,917
YOGA GIRL 1:
Mike wants to start trying for a baby.

183
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,756
OK?

184
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,156
No... I can't blow this body
on a baby, Steph.

185
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,396
I'm going to have to leave him.

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,874
SHE LAUGHS

187
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,240
What the fuck?

188
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,951
FLEABAG:
Oh, shit.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,320
YOGA GIRL 1:
That is not hygienic.

190
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:26,520
Sorry.

191
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,995
Oh, gross! We're leaving now.

192
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,438
I suppose you should meet Hilary.

193
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,914
Two years ago, I...

194
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,234
OK, the most important thing is

195
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,160
if you don't like it,
we can't take it back, OK?

196
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,184
OK.

197
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,439
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry, I panicked.

198
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,915
As long as I can wear it
or eat it, I'm happy.

199
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,837
You can do both of those things.

200
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,229
Oh my God! Did you get me a...
What is this?

201
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,509
I...
- SHE LAUGHS

202
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,437
What is...?
- I don't know!

203
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,391
What is it?
- Something to love?

204
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,795
She's beautiful!

205
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,478
THEY LAUGH

206
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,158
Thank you, you idiot.

207
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,077
FLEABAG:
Escape artist.

208
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,993
I don't feel anything about
guinea pigs, they're pointless.

209
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,475
But Boo took Hilary
very seriously as a gift

210
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,195
and soon everything
became guinea pig related.

211
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,593
This is an excellent one.

212
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,035
Drink?

213
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,549
SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

214
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,355
Look, I'm sorry about the mess.

215
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,435
No problem.

216
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,960
Do you want some
prosciutto with that?

217
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,054
Mmm.

218
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,158
He's so reliable.

219
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,079
Utterly inaccessible
and relentlessly profound.

220
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,033
All he wants is to get you in the bath
and ask questions like...

221
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,514
What are you afraid of?

222
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,716
And you find yourself saying things like...

223
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,991
I guess, losing
the currency of youth.

224
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,238
Ask me a question.

225
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,350
When did you realise
you were so good-looking?

226
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,269
I knew I was different
when I was about nine.

227
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,197
But shit got real around 11.

228
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,833
Shit got real?

229
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,191
You know. Aunts got weird.

230
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,912
I have another question.

231
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,273
OK.

232
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,358
Do you ever feel lonely?

233
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,314
Yeah. Of course.

234
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,389
Do you?

235
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,319
Never.

236
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,353
Do you want some pineapple?

237
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,074
Yeah.

238
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,478
God! Yeah!

239
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,640
Oh, they're so small. You are so small!

240
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,750
What?

241
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,120
They're so small.

242
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,230
So...

243
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,353
Small. God, they are so fucking tiny.

244
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,754
Yeah, I guess they're...

245
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,191
God, they're hardly even there!
I mean, what the fuck even are they?

246
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,913
Bit much.

247
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,754
Excuse me.

248
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,634
Oh yeah.

249
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,954
I'm having a Harry panic.

250
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,160
Madame Ovary is telling me
to run back to safe place.

251
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:37,402
I can make baby in safe place.

252
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:38,942
But... got to ride it out.

253
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,675
Mustn't... call... Ha...

254
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,672
Thanks for coming.

255
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,834
That's OK.

256
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,474
Are you OK?

257
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,670
Your message sounded urgent.

258
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,235
Were you busy?

259
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,759
No, I was in the interval...

260
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,870
Oh cool.
Of Cats.

261
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,797
OK.
- The musical.

262
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,117
Was it good?
- Really good actually. Really good.

263
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,639
Sorry for interrupting.

264
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,000
No, that's OK.

265
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,271
I got the feeling it wasn't
going to end well for the cats

266
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,314
so, I mean, probably good to remember
them like that, before they all...

267
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,920
Sorry. Are you OK?

268
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,640
Who were you with?

269
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,273
A work friend.

270
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,595
A girl.

271
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,558
Urn...

272
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,198
I found this.

273
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,519
Thanks.

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,593
I didn't realise I'd left it.

275
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,359
Why is your hair wet?

276
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,959
Don't look at me like that.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,752
Like what? Like what?

278
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,077
Look, I don't want
to sound cold or cruel or...

279
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,440
and I don't want you to think I'm just off
happy at the theater all the time either.

280
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:12,395
I'm not.

281
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,432
But... I'm not going to... I just...

282
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,430
If this is about us getting
back together, I was serious.

283
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,596
This time, I'm not just
going to come running back.

284
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,438
I really just need some time away from...

285
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,117
I'm so glad you called.

286
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,992
I'm so glad you picked up.

287
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,798
I've missed you.

288
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,513
I've missed you.

289
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,476
Oh my gosh, you feel good.

290
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,837
I wish he'd just fuck me.

291
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,996
All he wants to do is make love.

292
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,317
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm really good. I'm amazing.

293
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,277
He's wasting me.

294
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,473
I was once fucking this guy
who would breathe on every thrust.

295
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,875
You're so young! You're so young!

296
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,116
I masturbate about that all the time.

297
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,717
Masturbate a lot these days.

298
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,516
Especially when I'm bored.

299
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,272
Or angry.

300
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,629
Or upset.

301
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,034
Can we just...

302
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,559
Or happy.

303
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,559
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

304
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,954
Amazing.

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,035
Yeah.

306
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,516
Shall I...
- No, could you just... just stay there.

307
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,837
Oh, just don't... Yeah, no, don't. Just...

308
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,038
Yeah, ssh.

309
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,074
Yeah.

310
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,359
Yes, just... oh, just...

311
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,913
Oh God.

312
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,471
SHE MOANS

313
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,351
I think we should stop masturbating.

314
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,718
No, don't say anything yet.

315
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,038
I just think it might help us
focus on each other

316
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,957
you know, be more present.

317
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,196
Really successful couples do it, you know.

318
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:19,136
Um...

319
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,389
I've hidden our vibrators.

320
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Our?

321
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,039
I thought it might be fun.

322
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,275
To find them?

323
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,357
No. Just to try and not...

324
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,279
touch ourselves.

325
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,235
To try and save our touches
for each other.

326
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,315
What do you think?

327
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,715
Well, I think you're being really sexy.

328
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,989
Don't!

329
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,838
Ooh, I'm joking!

330
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,750
I never masturbate.
I don't know how.

331
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,036
Yeah, also, I thought we should
try and surprise each other

332
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,195
once every day.

333
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,390
Just a, you know, sweet little something

334
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,158
just to keep it, you know...

335
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,713
Are you getting this out of a book?

336
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,274
I've already planned
your first surprise, so...

337
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,193
don't eat too much before dinner.

338
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,033
See you later.

339
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,839
And I will see you later, too.

340
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,355
FLEABAG:
Oh!

341
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,869
Hi.

342
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,594
Just thought I'd pop by for some lunch.

343
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,914
Bit weird.

344
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,917
Yes. Well.

345
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,678
How are you? Quiet day?

346
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,951
Yeah, I'm fine.
You OK? You look stressed.

347
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,116
Well, I'm successful, so.

348
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,114
Do you have rye bread?

349
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,391
Er, no. But I have some normal bread
you can puke up after.

350
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,234
Great.

351
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,469
What do you want on it?

352
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,669
Oh, just tomatoes is fine.

353
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,159
Just tomatoes?

354
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,952
Just a tomato sandwich?

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,150
Yes. There a problem?

356
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,349
No.

357
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,960
Listen, I don't want to know
anything about this surprise party.

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,995
But if you could just... have it at mine,
this Friday at 7.30, that'd be great.

359
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,398
I can organise it and act surprised,
but if you could just...

360
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,829
Do you know what?
Why don't I just do it?

361
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,838
I can organise it,
do the food, act surprised

362
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,837
and just... take it off your hands.

363
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,440
I mean, I can see that you're busy, so.

364
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,794
OK. If you want.

365
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,515
Well, I don't want to, but I think it'd be
easier for everyone if I could just...

366
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,630
OK.

367
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,594
I mean, I've done it. It's done.
It's this Friday at 7.30, at mine.

368
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,880
Great.

369
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,712
How behind are you?
If it's money that you need...

370
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,080
I don't need money.

371
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,671
That'll be £25, please.

372
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,429
London.

373
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Thanks.

374
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,640
Can't believe that thing's still alive.

375
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,150
Oh, um... any news on Harry?

376
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,474
Yeah, we're back together.

377
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,477
Oh God. I can't keep up.

378
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,074
Hello?

379
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,479
Harry?

380
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,593
Oh... Shit!

381
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,475
Surprise, surprise, surprise...

382
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,276
Surprise!
- HARRY SCREAMS

383
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,559
It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!

384
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,910
Why would you do that?
I thought I was going to get raped!

385
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,110
I'm sorry! I just...
Baby, I'm sorry.

386
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,400
I thought you wanted a surprise.
It was a ninja surprise.

387
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:35,589
Oh my God, my heart.
I'm shaking so much. Oh my God.

388
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,995
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

389
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,514
Oh my God!

390
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,073
Oh...
- Oh my God.

391
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,236
OK. It's OK. Are you OK?

392
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,839
Oh my God.

393
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,120
Did you have a good day?
- I did, yeah. It was fine, thanks.

394
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:50,879
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't think...

395
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,639
I didn't think you were
going to react like that. I...

396
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,469
I'm sorry, it was a joke.

397
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,593
It was a good joke.

398
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,149
Jesus.

399
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,157
I thought you'd be later.

400
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,634
Yeah, I...
- HARRY SCREAMS

401
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,875
Oh my God!

402
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,355
Oh, God, sorry, Ijust...
I think I'm still in shock.

403
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,079
That was horrible.

404
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,633
It was a surprise.

405
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,752
I know. Thank you. It's fine.

406
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,958
Shall I go and get us some wine?

407
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,235
OK.

408
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,920
I know what you look like!
I know what you took!

409
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,837
That is the last time!

410
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,869
Splashed out on a
special bottle for a special...

411
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,555
Harry?

412
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,399
Had to go into the history
on my computer

413
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,831
to find something I'd seen on the
H&M website this morning, and...

414
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,279
I don't want to point fingers, but...

415
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,633
anal, gangbang, mature,
big cock, small tits

416
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,517
hentai, Asian, teen, MILF,
big butts, lesbian, gay

417
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,791
facial, fetish, bukakke, young and old

418
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,073
swallow, rough, voyeur, and public.

419
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,636
Why are you being so sexy?

420
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,871
Don't make me hate you.

421
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,591
Loving you is painful enough.

422
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,553
OK, sorry.

423
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,150
But I really think you should
write that down.

424
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,496
I know it's not appropriate, but I really
think you should write that down.

425
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,920
It's really good for a line.
- I'm not going to write down...

426
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,769
No, no, I'm serious!
For your songs and stuff.

427
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:48,660
It's perfect.
It's poetic, yet real. Serious.

428
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,433
Don't make me...

429
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,710
Hate you.
- Yeah, I know! Thank you!

430
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,993
Loving you is painful...

431
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,032
What am I doing?

432
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,920
There's someone at work who loves me.

433
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,560
Well, she told me she loves me,
and I said we couldn't be together

434
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,461
because I had to know.

435
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,313
Do you want to be alone?

436
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,113
You will never see me again.

437
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,431
I'll always love you,
but I just can't take it anymore.

438
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,032
I don't hate you, I'm scared for you.

439
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,038
He's going to write that down.

440
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,792
I don't hate you... scared.

441
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,875
I'm going to go pack my things up
from the bedroom again. But...

442
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,672
I'm not going to clean.

443
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,109
It's still in pretty good shape, so.

444
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,596
If I don't see you after that, goodbye.

445
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Forever.

446
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,954
He'll be back.
